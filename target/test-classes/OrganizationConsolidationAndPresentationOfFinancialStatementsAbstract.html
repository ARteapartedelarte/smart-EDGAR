<p style="margin-top: 6px; text-indent: 104px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><font style="font-family: Times New Roman;" size="2" class="_mt">The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Comprehensive Care Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries, which include Comprehensive Behavioral Care, Inc. ("CBC") and Core Corporate Consulting Group, Inc. ("Core"), each with their respective subsidiaries (collectively referred to herein as, the "Company," "CompCare," "we", "us," or "our") . </font></p>

<p style="margin-top: 18px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><font style="font-family: Times New Roman;" size="2" class="_mt"><i>Nature of operations: </i></font></p>

<p style="margin-top: 6px; text-indent: 104px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><font style="font-family: Times New Roman;" size="2" class="_mt">We provide managed care services in the behavioral health, substance abuse, and psychotropic pharmacy management fields for commercial, Medicare, Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program ("CHIP") members primarily on behalf of health plans. We also provide behavioral pharmaceutical management services for two health plans in Puerto Rico. Our managed care operations include administrative service agreements, fee-for-service agreements, and capitation contracts. The customer base for our services includes both private and governmental entities. Our services are provided by unrelated vendors on a subcontract basis. </font></p>

<p style="margin-top: 12px; text-indent: 104px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><font style="font-family: Times New Roman;" size="2" class="_mt">The majority of our managed care activities are performed under at-risk arrangements pursuant to terms of agreements with health plans to provide contracted behavioral healthcare and pharmacy services to subscribing members. For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2011 and 2010, such agreements accounted for 96%, or $68.4 million, and 94%, or $32.9 million, respectively, of our revenue. We include cost sharing/cost savings provisions in certain agreements with health plans whereby we share in the additional cost or cost savings when comparing actual claims costs to the estimated claims costs incorporated into the contract's pricing. We contract with various healthcare providers including hospitals, physician groups and other licensed behavioral healthcare professionals either on a discounted fee-for-service or a per-case basis. We determine that a member has received services when we receive a claim within the contracted timeframe with all required billing elements correctly completed by the service provider. We then determine whether the member is eligible to receive the service, the service provided is medically necessary and is covered by the benefit plan's certificate of coverage, and the service is authorized by one of our employees. </font></p>

<p style="margin-top: 12px; text-indent: 104px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><font style="font-family: Times New Roman;" size="2" class="_mt">We also manage the psychotropic drug benefit under certain behavioral health contracts for certain health plans' subscribing members and are responsible for the cost of drugs dispensed. In accordance with the contracts, the health plan's pharmacy benefit manager ("PBM") performs drug price negotiation and claims adjudication. </font></p>

<p style="margin-top: 18px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><font style="font-family: Times New Roman;" size="2" class="_mt"><i>Going concern basis: </i></font></p>

<p style="margin-top: 6px; text-indent: 104px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><font style="font-family: Times New Roman;" size="2" class="_mt">The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the basis that the Company will continue its operations as a going concern. As a result of certain conditions described in Note 7, our ability to continue as a going concern will be dependent upon the success of management's plans, as set forth also in Note 7, and is subject to significant uncertainty. Except for the consideration in determining the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets from net operating loss carryforwards (Note 9), the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.</font></p> </div></td></tr>
