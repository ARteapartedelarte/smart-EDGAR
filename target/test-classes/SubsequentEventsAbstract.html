<p style="margin-top: 12px; text-indent: 104px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><font style="font-family: Times New Roman;" size="2" class="_mt">On January&nbsp;4, 2012, we issued 250 restricted shares of Series D Stock, par value $50 per share, to an officer and certain board members. As a condition for the grants, the recipients of the grants surrendered for cancellation all warrants for the purchase of up to 120 shares of such preferred stock. The granted Series D Stock will contain a ten-year vesting period but have the voting, dividend, liquidation and other rights of a share of Series D Stock effective from the date of grant. Upon the 10th anniversary of the grant date, each share of Series D Stock may be converted into 100,000 shares of our common stock, or an aggregate of 25,000,000 common shares.</font></p> </div></td></tr>
